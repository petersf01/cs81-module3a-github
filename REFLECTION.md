# Reflection

## What did you learn about using Git and GitHub?
Its a nice way to backup and save your code.

## What was most confusing or frustrating?
I found the login part confusing. Git no longer accepts a username and password to log in. I needed to create a token to log in with. At first I thought I did something wrong and it took a while for me to try the token route.

## Why do you think developers use Git?
Its a nice way to see changes and backup your work.

## How might this help with larger projects in the future?
I know Git has features to allow develpers work in parallell and add their code together in a coordinated manner.
